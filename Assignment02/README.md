# Assignment_02 of "Verteilte Verarbeitung"
## RESTful client server
This is a RESTful server application, that provides basic CRUD interaction with Customers and their contracts.
    - Application runs with SpringBoot(H2, SpringBootSecurity)

### Getting Started

1. Try to get the code running in your IDE 
    - Create new **SpringBoot**-Application using **Gradle** and copy/paste source code
    
3. **CURL**-commands and other on: *https://documenter.getpostman.com/collection/view/3815462-ae0c490f-c3a2-442a-9c0f-5610cebc55f1*

### Before interacting with Server/API

1. This server uses a **self-signed SSL-Certificate**
    - If you make requests with *Browser*: Accept Website as trustworthy in general to be able to interact with API
    - If you are using *Postman*: Settings -> General -> SSL-Certification **off**

2. **Authenticate** yourself by posting to "https://localhost/8443/user" or you will get status code **401** (Unauthorized), when interacting with other endpoints.

### Authentication

1. This application uses basic authentication. Only then you will be able to get, create, update and delete entities.

### Error Codes

1. Successfull get and delete requests return status code **200** (ok)

2. Successfull post and put requests lead to **201** (created)

3. Sometimes you get a **400** (bad request)
    - For example: Posting an invalid contract- or customer-entity (look up **json entity** for **contract**/**customer** beneath)

4. A get, put or delete request to a non-existing source will lead to **404** (not found) 
    - Or you do a request to an url that is not specified

5. There are several reasons for a **409** (Conflict)
    - Your update leads to a **lost** of an preceeding **update**
    - You try to **delete** a **resource**, that is **referenced** by an other
    - You try to create user with a **username** that **already exists**

6. Else 500 if an unexpected error occurs. Please report
